The Kalman variational auto-encoder is a framework for unsupervised learning of sequential data that disentangles two latent representations: an objectâ€™s representation, coming from a recognition model, and a latent state describing its dynamics. The recognition model is represented by a convolutional variational auto-encoder and the latent dynamics model as a linear Gaussian state space model (LGSSM).

## Main Results
As shown in the paper, the KVAE can be trained end-to-end, and is able learn a recognition and dynamics model from the videos. 
The model can be used to generate new sequences, as well as to do missing data imputation without the need to generate high-dimensional frames at each time step.

### Videos
Videos of simulations are available for many of the experiments here: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7BmG5ubHI3UeDNLbVVXWDRVUnM?usp=sharing).

## Installation instructions
The Kalman Variational Auto-Encoder (KVAE) package can be installed running
```
# Install requirements
pip install tensorflow-gpu numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Clone the kvae repository and install it
git clone https://github.com/simonkamronn/kvae
cd kvae
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies
- Python >= 2.7 or 3.5
- Tensorflow >= 1.1

### Data
The data used in the experiments is available for download here: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7BmG5ubHI3UeDNLbVVXWDRVUnM?usp=sharing). Once downloaded, it needs to be placed in the `data` folder in the root directory.  
The scripts we used to generate the video sequences can be found in `kvae/datasets`, and depend on pygame and the pymunk physics engine (and their dependencies).

## Usage Example
In the `examples` folder execute the command
```
python run_kvae.py  --gpu=0
```
to train a model using the default bouncing ball dataset and parameters. To train a model with different parameters run
```
python run_kvae.py  --help
```
to view the configuration options or look in `kvae/utils/config.py`. Further details on the experimental setup can be found in the paper and in the supplementary material.
